Welcome to OpenPublic


OpenPublic is a Drupal-based content management system (CMS) born from a decade
of work building secure, scalable, transparent websites for all sectors of
government. It is a community-driven platform supported by a network of
innovative open source contributors committed to Open Government.

OpenPublic was built for the public sector, but is not limited in any way as to
who can or should use it. The features and content types are built to meet the
common needs of government agencies, organizations, municipalities, and states,
but OpenPublic is regularly used to create sites too for nonprofit
organizations, foreign governments, and other initiatives.
